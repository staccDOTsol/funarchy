Programs for market-driven governance.

## Scripts

The scripts folder contains a few scripts that you can use to interact with the Meta-DAO.
Today, the only way to create proposals is via script. You can do this by modifying the
`initializeProposal.ts` script and replacing its `pubkey`, `accounts`, and `data` with the
SVM instruction that you want to use in your proposal.

Then, run `anchor run propose --provider.cluster CLUSTER`, where `CLUSTER` is replaced with
either devnet, mainnet, or (recommended) an RPC URL.

### Initialize Proposal

The initialize proposal script initializes conditional vaults, which also attempts to upload metadata for conditional tokens. If a previous attempt to call this script failed part way through and off-chain metadata has already been uploaded, you can use this metadata and bypass another attempt to upload off-chain metadata.

Simply prepend the script with the following environment variable structure: `[PASS|FAIL]_[TOKEN]_METADATA_URI`. For example, to override pass and fail META metadata uploads, include `PASS_META_METADATA_URI` and `FAIL_META_METADATA_URI`.

The actual script invocation might look something like this:

```bash
PASS_META_METADATA_URI=\"<P_URI>\" FAIL_META_METADATA_URI=\"<F_URI>\" anchor run propose
```

where `P_URI` and `F_URI` are replaced with their respective values.
